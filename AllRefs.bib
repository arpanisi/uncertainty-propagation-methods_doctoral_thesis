	on all available measurement data provides the most complete possible
	description of the state, and from this density any of the common
	types of estimates (e.g., minimum variance or maximum a posteriori)
	can be determined. Except in the linear Gaussian case, it is extremely
	difficult to determine this density function. In this paper an approximation
	that permits the explicit calculation of the a posteriori density
	from the Bayesian recursion relations is discussed and applied to
	the solution of the nonlinear filtering problem. In particular, it
	is noted that a weighted sum of Gaussian probability density functions
	can be used to approximate arbitrarily closely another density function.
	This representation provides the basis for procedure that is developed
	and discussed.},

	estimation algorithm for nonlinear systems. However, more than 35
	years of experience in the estimation community has shown that is
	difficult to implement, difficult to tune, and only reliable for
	systems that are almost linear on the time scale of the updates.
	Many of these difficulties arise from its use of linearization. To
	overcome this limitation, the unscented transformation (UT) was developed
	as a method to propagate mean and covariance information through
	nonlinear transformations. It is more accurate, easier to implement,
	and uses the same order of calculations as linearization. This paper
	reviews the motivation, development, use, and implications of the
	UT.},

  abstract = {This paper considers the application of the unscented Kalman filter
	(UKF) to continuous-time filtering problems, where both the state
	and measurement processes are modeled as stochastic differential
	equations. The mean and covariance differential equations which result
	in the continuous-time limit of the UKF are derived. The continuous-discrete
	UKF is derived as a special case of the continuous-time filter, when
	the continuous-time prediction equations are combined with the update
	step of the discrete-time UKF. The filter equations are also transformed
	into sigma-point differential equations, which can be interpreted
	as matrix square root versions of the filter equations.},

	on all available measurement data provides the most complete possible
	description of the state, and from this density any of the common
	types of estimates (e.g., minimum variance or maximum a posteriori)
	can be determined. Except in the linear \textsc{G}aussian case, it is extremely
	difficult to determine this density function. In this paper an approximation
	that permits the explicit calculation of the a posteriori density
	from the Bayesian recursion relations is discussed and applied to
	the solution of the nonlinear filtering problem. In particular, it
	is noted that a weighted sum of \textsc{G}aussian probability density functions
	can be used to approximate arbitrarily closely another density function.
	This representation provides the basis for procedure that is developed
	and discussed.},

  abstract = {The extended \textsc{K}alman filter (EKF) is probably the most widely used
	estimation algorithm for nonlinear systems. However, more than 35
	years of experience in the estimation community has shown that is
	difficult to implement, difficult to tune, and only reliable for
	systems that are almost linear on the time scale of the updates.
	Many of these difficulties arise from its use of linearization. To
	overcome this limitation, the unscented transformation (UT) was developed
	as a method to propagate mean and covariance information through
	nonlinear transformations. It is more accurate, easier to implement,
	and uses the same order of calculations as linearization. This paper
	reviews the motivation, development, use, and implications of the
	UT.},

  abstract = {Knowledge of the probability density function of the state conditioned
	on all available measurement data provides the most complete possible
	description of the state, and from this density any of the common
	types of estimates (e.g., minimum variance or maximum a posteriori)
	can be determined. Except in the linear \textsc{G}aussian case, it is extremely
	difficult to determine this density function. In this paper an approximation
	that permits the explicit calculation of the a posteriori density
	from the Bayesian recursion relations is discussed and applied to
	the solution of the nonlinear filtering problem. In particular, it
	is noted that a weighted sum of \textsc{G}aussian probability density functions
	can be used to approximate arbitrarily closely another density function.
	This representation provides the basis for procedure that is developed
	and discussed.},

  abstract = {The extended \textsc{K}alman filter (EKF) is probably the most widely used
	estimation algorithm for nonlinear systems. However, more than 35
	years of experience in the estimation community has shown that is
	difficult to implement, difficult to tune, and only reliable for
	systems that are almost linear on the time scale of the updates.
	Many of these difficulties arise from its use of linearization. To
	overcome this limitation, the unscented transformation (UT) was developed
	as a method to propagate mean and covariance information through
	nonlinear transformations. It is more accurate, easier to implement,
	and uses the same order of calculations as linearization. This paper
	reviews the motivation, development, use, and implications of the
	UT.},

	the continuous-time prediction equations are combined with the update
	step of the discrete-time UKF. The filter equations are also transformed
